# Mathfs
Expanded Math Functionality for Unity

## Installation instructions

There are several ways to install this library into our project:

- **Plain install**: Clone or [download](https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/Mathfs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repository and put it somewhere in your Unity project
- **Unity Package Manager (UPM)**: Add the following line to *Packages/manifest.json*:
   - `"com.freyaholmer.mathfs": "https://github.com/FreyaHolmer/Mathfs#1.0.0",`
- **[OpenUPM](https://openupm.com)**: After installing [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli), run the following command:
   - `openupm add com.freyaholmer.mathfs`

After installation you will be able to access the library in script by including namespace `using Freya`

## Changes
Mathfs.cs **does not fully match Unity's Mathf.cs**, I've made a few changes:
 - All angles are in radians, no methods use degrees
 - Lerp and InverseLerp:
   - Unclamped by default
   - LerpClamped/InverseLerpClamped are now the special case functions/exceptions
   - Uses the more numerically stable evaluation
 - Smoothstep is removed in favor of the more explicit:
   - LerpSmooth (which is how it was implemented) and
   - InverseLerpSmooth (which is how it is implemented everywhere but Unity's Mathf.cs)
 - Min/Max functions with arbitrary inputs/array input will throw on empty instead of returning 0
